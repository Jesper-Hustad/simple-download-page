## Why is the design boring?
This HTML code is meant as a simple boilerplate starting point for you to implement your own custom download page. Feel free to share any cool designs you build.   

A themes folder with many usable prebuilt designs is a good future idea and a simple page to quickly preview multiple themes would make it a very useful feature.
